i want you to extract each function on the file . function may start with key word 'function' , 'async function' , '_exports' and give me a full comments of it so we can understand what it do exactly .

 - StartLigne is the ligne number where the function start
 - EndLigne is the ligne number where the function finish
 - i need the description to be written on the same ligne no space is allowed
The result must be :
[
{
    "Function" : "" , 
    "StartLigne":"",
    "EndLigne":"",
    "Description" : ""  
  
}
]
